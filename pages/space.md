Our space is currently located at [662 Princes Hwy, Rockdale](/joining#location), in a rather ordinary looking house with no special signage. It consists of a house and a shed out back, with various rooms.

### Miriam's Room

This room is first on the left named after Miriam whose collection of fabrics and patterns was donated to the space. This room is used for Board Meetings, and has a vast collection of fabrics, patterns, and other clothing related tools and ingredients. We have an old sewing machine. This room is also the best place to play with radioactive sources, harsh chemicals, lasers or other risky light sources.

### Junk Room

First on your right is our Junk Room. Anything you find in this room without someoneâ€™s name on it is now yours to make things of! At the time of writing it mostly stores electronic junk and some mechanical doodads, ranging from computers to model helicopters. , and a reasonable collection of older mobile phones, as well as nearly endless supplies of stepper motors and random circuit boards with all sorts of interesting and useful bits on them.

### Laser Room

Second on the left is the bizarrely named Laser room, which at the time of writing contains no usable lasers. What it does contain is pretty special though: Two CNC machines, Two miniature metal lathes, a giant partially functioning spectrograph and DNA replicator, a couple of old school oscilloscopes and bits to make all that stuff work. You can CNC circuit boards, aluminium blocks, whatever you need really.

### Main Room

The main area opens up forward and to the right, where we have tables, chairs, buckets of soldering irons, a projector, a media computer, an Apple AirPlay enabled HiFi, wireless internet, ethernet wired networking, a [MakerBot](http://makerbot.com/) which works some of the time, and a general supply of screwdrivers, hand-formable thermoplastics, glues, heat guns, drills, dremmels, multimeters and a handheld oscilloscope.

### Kitchen

Left of the main room is our kitchen, with running hot and cold water, a fridge full of caffeinated and caffeine free softdrink, juices, ginger beer. A toaster oven, microwave, and kettle provide some basic cookery which we're looking to expand in the future. There's usually some Mi Goreng floating around, or you can grab a kebab across the road, or visit the food court or supermarket a block away.

### Back Room / Bathroom

Past the main room is a small room where some members projects and more tools are stored, including blow torches, chemicals for mischief and making sherbet, plumbing tools, a garbage bin, and a small bathroom. Through the back door we have a fairly big yard with barbecue and a shed.

### The Shed

The shed has drill presses, saws, hammers, an electric kiln, a gas furnace, band saw, heaps of screws and other random scraps, and really just far too many random metal and woodworking tools to list here.
