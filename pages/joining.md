Joining the space involves a few things. First up, you'll need to visit the space and come meet us and have some fun times. Your first visit is always free, unless we're running a special event that day with consumable costs which you participate in - in which case you'll be able to visit another day for free.

<h3 id="location"> Getting to the Space </h3>

Currently Robots and Dinosaurs is located at [662 Princes Hwy, Rockdale][gmaps]. It appears as a regular house, and lacks any specific signage.

Notably, to the right of the front step there's a model dinosaur glued down at about elbow height. Visiting should be done on open days, which at the time of writing are on Fridays, Saturdays, and Mondays at varying times. Check our [mailing list](/mailing-list) to confirm when the space will be open on any particular day, or phone the space on [8033 2318](tel:+61-2-8033-2318) before dropping in to see if anyone's around. If nobody at the space picks up, you can also call [our secretary](/board-members) at any sensible time. Ensure youâ€™re in Rockdale as house numbers reset along Princes Highway at the edge of each suburb.

<h3 id="transport"> Public Transport Advice </h3>

Trains running to Rockdale and Kogarah station from Central and Redfern stations are available on the Illawarra line at least every half hour for most of the day. Kogarah and Rockdale stations are both equally distant from the space, so just pick whichever works best for you. The walk will take about ten minutes from either station.

The 422 bus departs from Circular Quay, Elizabeth St near Town Hall, Railway Square, and King St in Newtown. The bus takes about 25 minutes from Railway Square and drops you off directly in front of the space.

If you live in the Eastern Suburbs or near the airport, you can catch the 400 bus to Rockdale Station, then walk for ten minutes. This bus takes 40 minutes from Randwick.

<h3 id="membership"> Membership Pricing </h3>

Our space is entirely funded through the generosity of members and donors, and so we encourage you to give whatever is within your means. [Membership](/membership) is $40 per month minimum, with the option to give more if you can spare it. For students and starving hackers, we offer half price membership. If you're unsure about joining, and wish to visit a second time, a $10 single day membership is available, though we discourage using single day memberships regularly, as it makes planning finances more difficult and excludes you from the possibility of an electronic key.

As a paying member, you'll be able to visit on any open days without further expenses beyond material costs on special events. After being a member for a few months the board will consider giving you full membership, which entitles you to an electronic key and access any time. You'll have the option of opening the space for others when visiting, or just quietly making use of our tools, and the right to vote in board elections.

If you have any questions, direct them to [our secretary](/board-members).
